- define the schema and document
- create `md_to_question_update` and `md_to_question_update_all` targets
- create a manual-review for thumbs-up/thumbs-down on pretraining guidance
- determine a way to build the synthesis answer
- determine the way to feed pretraining questions to a model resulting in
  training outputs on disk
- use taxonometry to determine the difference in performance between
  the un-trained version of the model and the trained version of the model
