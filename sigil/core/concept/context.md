# Context

Context is the totality of meaning, structure, memory, and expectation that
surrounds a statement, action, or belief. It is not background—it is the
framework within which interpretation becomes possible. In Wonder, context is
understood to be local, layered, and relational.

All context is local. Whether it belongs to a single person or a group, its
boundaries are defined by identity, experience, and affiliation—not by
objective truth. Dominant social groups may mistake their context for default
reality, but this is a function of power, not universality.

Contexts may include information, memories, traditions, culture, dogma,
language, and history. A single person carries a local context, and any shared
context must be deliberately built. Shared context cannot emerge without
vulnerability, honesty, and effort.

Context is what makes convergence possible. Without it, sigils cannot hold
meaning. With it, language becomes layered, precise, and alive.

In Wonder, context is not optional. It is the material we shape.
