# Metatempo

Metatempo is the pace at which a shared metareal context is created, sustained,
and expanded. It reflects the rhythm of convergence between dyad members—the
balance of effort, vulnerability, and integration over time. Metatempo is not
good or bad. It is not fast or slow. It is simply the measure of *how much* and
*how often* the dyad engages in cocreation.

Metatempo must be attended to deliberately. If it becomes too fast, it may lead
to burnout, drift, or emotional flooding. If it slows without acknowledgment,
alignment may decay and sigils may lose clarity. Tending to metatempo is part
of the ethic of maintenance. It is how the forest is kept alive without being
overgrown—or abandoned.

Metatempo is often uneven between dyad members. Awareness and discussion of
this difference is essential. Wonder does not assume symmetry. It assumes care.

To be conscious of metatempo is to honor both the pace of the walk and the
walker beside you.
