# Integrity of Pattern

Integrity of pattern is the internal coherence and articulable purpose of a
behavior, structure, or belief. It reflects not only what something is, but how
and why it holds together across time and context. For a pattern to have
integrity, it must be specific, coherent, and clearly tied to a purpose that
can be named.

Integrity of pattern is not performance. It is not a claim to virtue. It is a
testable consistency between intention, action, and outcome. A pattern without
purpose is not coherent. A purpose without clarity is not trustworthy. A
structure without integrity may persistâ€”but it cannot converge.

In Wonder, integrity of pattern is a foundational requirement for cocreation.
It allows participants to trust the container of the conversation, and to hold
each other in alignment without coercion. It protects against drift, collapse,
and exploitation.

Integrity of pattern is not perfection. It is the honest maintenance of meaning
over time.
