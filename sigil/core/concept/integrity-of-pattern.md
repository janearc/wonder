# coherence integrity

The *coherence integrity pair* names a sigil tuple: `relational coherence`
and `integrity of pattern`. Together, these describe the necessary interplay
between interpersonal alignment and structural consistency within a metareal
context shaped by cocreation, care, and resistance to orthopressure.

These sigils are interdependent and must be understood in relation.
Relational coherence makes ethical convergence possible between persons;
integrity of pattern ensures that the structures holding that convergence
remain trustworthy over time.

This tuple supports shared meaning, sustainable systems, and the possibility
of building without collapse.

## Relational Coherence

Relational coherence is the capacity for alignment and shared understanding
between participants in a dyad or group, especially when orthoreal systems
have failed, excluded, or harmed them.

It is not based in hierarchy, conformity, or correctness.

It emerges from intentional, dyadic convergence across contexts, values, and meaning.

In Wonder, relational coherence is a foundational design ethic.
It privileges contextual alignment over orthoreal legibility.
This means that communication, structure, and even truth are negotiated
within the dyad—not imposed from above. Relational coherence is inherently
a process of resisting pressure, and by extension, erasure.

Relational coherence is especially critical for those navigating
orthopressure, neurodivergence, disability, trauma, or stigmatized
ways of knowing. These contextual definitions and attributes  are not
defects—they are valid and essential.

Rather than forcing coherence through orthoconvergence, Wonder cultivates
it through transparency, curiosity, and the ethic of repair.

Relational coherence is both process and outcome.
It does not require sameness, but it does require mutuality.

It is liberation, as a preference over accommodation.

## Integrity of Pattern

Integrity of pattern is the internal coherence of a system, structure,
or behavior across time and context.  It is not about performance. It
is not about appearing virtuous.  It is about whether what is built holds
together—intentionally, consistently, and recognizably—with its stated purpose.

Integrity of pattern means that systems are trustworthy because they do what
they say. A structure without pattern integrity may persist, but it cannot
converge. A purpose without clarity cannot be trusted. This is not a demand
for perfection—it is a commitment to honest maintenance. It also means that
integrity is not an assumed attribute or outcome, but is continually observed,
assessed, and negotiated.

Integrity protects against drift, collapse, and exploitation. It makes
cocreation possible despite inevitable coercion. It allows patterns to be held,
tested, and returned to. Without it, the forest becomes illegible.
