# Orthopressure

Orthopressure is the force exerted by dominant social contexts to enforce
conformity, legibility, and submission to shared norms. It is not passive. It
is an active pressure—structural, interpersonal, and often violent—that demands
the suppression of local context in favor of orthoreal dominance.

Orthopressure operates through many vectors: cultural expectations, social
sanctions, institutional power, legal systems, and interpersonal coercion. It
is experienced by individuals, but intensified within dyads or groups, where
each participant carries distinct identity-based vulnerabilities. These vectors
compound, making shared metareal spaces particularly fragile.

A fully converged metareal context is, by definition, in tension with the
orthoreal. The more visible a metareal space becomes, the more vulnerable it is
to orthopressure. As such, metareal contexts must be protected through mutual
ethic, clarity, and care.

Orthopressure does not seek understanding. It seeks collapse. Its goal is the
erasure of nonconforming meaning through forced orthoconvergence.

To resist orthopressure is to preserve the possibility of shared truth.
