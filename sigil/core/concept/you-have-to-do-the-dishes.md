# You Have to Do the Dishes

You have to do the dishes is the sigil that marks the necessary work of
convergence before the rewards of deep intimacy can emerge. It names the
unavoidable truth that shared reality requires effort, especially when the
initial excitement—novelty, attraction, new relational energy—fades.

Everyone wants the feast. Fewer want to clean up after. But in Wonder, the
dishes *are* the relationship. They are the clarifying conversations, the slow
alignment checks, the rituals of repair, and the ethic of maintenance that
preserve the forest long after the celebration ends.

This sigil also marks a caution: relationships built only on novelty will not
survive the transition into sustained cocreation unless the ethic of effort is
already present. You must be willing to build while it’s still easy, or the
work will feel harder when it becomes necessary.

You have to do the dishes is not a punishment. It is a promise. It means: I am
here. I will stay. I will help you hold this, even when the sparkle fades.
