# Alignment

Alignment is the state of mutual understanding and agreement within a shared
context. It occurs when two or more participants hold the same meaning for a
sigil, principle, or structure—not just intellectually, but emotionally and
ethically. Alignment is both a goal and a process. It is never assumed. It must
be built.

Alignment does not require total agreement. It requires shared recognition of
meaning. Participants may hold different positions while remaining aligned if
they share understanding, intention, and a commitment to coherence.

In Wonder, alignment governs convergence. It is the standard by which shared
sigils are marked stable, and the condition required for meaningful
communication. Misalignment is not failure—it is an opportunity to return to
the work.

Alignment is also fragile. It can drift, fracture, or decay. When it does, the
ethic of Wonder demands that participants slow down and reconverge rather than
force consensus. The integrity of the metareal depends on this care.

Alignment is not sameness. It is shared clarity.
