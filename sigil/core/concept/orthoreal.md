# Orthoreal

The orthoreal is the domain of socially enforced reality structured by dominant
contexts. It is not singular; orthoreal systems are layered, overlapping, and
relative to power. Orthoreality is what is publicly legible, culturally
normative, and institutionally reinforced. It defines what “makes sense” within
a dominant frame.

Participation in orthoreal contexts often requires suppressing or translating
one’s local context to conform to dominant expectations. Orthoreal meaning is
scalable, standardized, and general. It is maintained through infrastructure:
law, education, media, economics, and social control.

Orthoreal contexts may absorb sigils from metareal or marginal spaces, but only
under specific conditions and often with distortion. When a sigil is extracted
from a metareal context and recontextualized without consent, it loses meaning,
becoming legible but no longer alive.

The orthoreal is not truth. It is *power posing as truth*.
