# Metareal

The metareal is the domain of cocreated reality that emerges through
convergence of local contexts. It is relational, recursive, and specific. It
cannot be understood from the outside—it must be built from within.

The metareal resists generalization. Its meaning is shaped by shared language,
trust, vulnerability, and alignment. It is the space where sigils live fully,
carrying memory, feeling, and ethical weight. What matters in the metareal is
coherence, not conformity; clarity, not scale.

The metareal is not a fantasy. It is a distinct epistemology. It offers safety,
intimacy, and precision—but only when tended. As it becomes more visible, it
also becomes more vulnerable to orthopressure. Its beauty is in its fragility.

Seep may carry metareal sigils into other contexts, but once they enter the
orthoreal, drift is inevitable. What returns is not what was sent.
