# Forced Orthoconvergence

Forced orthoconvergence is the process by which dominant contexts compel
individuals or groups to collapse their local meaning into orthoreal forms. It
is not convergence through mutual understandingâ€”it is submission through
orthopressure. It erases complexity, relational depth, and emotional specificity 
in order to produce legibility to power.

Forced orthoconvergence is the weapon of orthopressure. It does not create
shared context. It replaces it with sanctioned structure. Its tools include
punishment, ridicule, surveillance, institutional control, and social
exclusion. It is often framed as reasonableness, neutrality, or maturity, but
its function is always the same: to overwrite the local with the dominant.

In Wonder, forced orthoconvergence represents the opposite of seep. It is not
fluid. It is violent. It collapses divergence into sameness, not through trust,
but through annihilation. In extreme cases, it destroys not just sigils, but
the people and relationships that carry them.

Forced orthoconvergence is also known as erasure.
