# Rupture

Rupture is a sudden break in alignment within a shared metareal context. It is
not drift, which occurs gradually, and it is not burnout, which arises from
sustained failure. Rupture is event-based—an acute breach in trust, clarity, or
shared meaning. It marks a point where convergence fails and the path between
participants is interrupted.

Rupture may be caused by miscommunication, emotional overwhelm, unmet needs,
violation of ethic, or destabilization of a core sigil. It is not inherently a
failure. It is a signal that something meaningful has broken and must be
acknowledged.

In Wonder, rupture is not avoided—it is addressed. The presence of rupture
invites the work of repair. If handled with care, rupture can become a turning
point toward deeper convergence and stronger alignment.

If ignored or mishandled, rupture can lead to drift, erosion of context, or
burnout.

Rupture is not the end of the forest. It is a clearing where the next path
must be chosen and what must change--because rupture requries change.
