# Axiom: Context Is Structure

Context is not background. It is not scenery, filler, or atmosphere. Context is
the *structure* of meaning itselfâ€”the framework that determines how a word, act,
or idea is interpreted. Without context, nothing can be understood. With
context, meaning becomes specific, relational, and alive.

Every culture, subculture, dyad, or individual maintains a distinct context.
The more converged a context, the more precise and layered its meaning becomes.
Context is what gives sigils weight. It is the architecture of shared reality.

In Wonder, context is the medium through which all communication travels. It is
not optional. It is not secondary. It is the terrain itself.

To disregard context is to abandon coherence.
