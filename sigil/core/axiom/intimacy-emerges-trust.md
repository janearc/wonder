# Intimacy Emerges from Trust

**Intimacy is a measurement of trust.**  

Trust is a function of two things:

- The capacity for realignment  
- The number of times alignment has been reached within a given contextual frame

We do not build intimacy by staying perfectly aligned.  
Intimacy is not perfect alignment. It is built by *returning*—again and again—proving
that relational coherence is not static, but **negotiated, repaired, and willingly re-entered.**

Another way to express this succinctly is "intimacy is built on rupture and repair."
