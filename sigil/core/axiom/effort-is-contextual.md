# effort is contextual

Effort cannot be measured from outside its context. Orthoreal systems are  
definitionally incapable of evaluating effort within metareal conditions.  
What appears insufficient may be the full extent of what can be offered.

An ethic of dialectics holds that both can be true:  
- A person is doing the best they can  
- An orthoreal evaluation may still see failure

Within a metareal context, the truth remains:  
This is the best that can be offered. That is valid.

The axiom of contextualized effort, within an ethic of care, dictates a  
presumption: people are doing the best they can.

This presumption is not naïve—it is resistant.  
An ethic of care demands the metareal be held as primary.  
This preference is not indulgence. It is justice.
