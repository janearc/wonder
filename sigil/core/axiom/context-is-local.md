# context is local

All context is local—whether it belongs to a single person or to a group. Its
boundaries are defined by identity, experience, and affiliation, and do not
represent objective truth. Rather, a context expresses a shared perception of
what is true *to that group*, which may feel objective due to the number of
people who participate in it.

Shared context does not mean universal context. Dominant social groups often
mistake their context for default reality—but this is a function of power, not
accuracy.

**All context is local** is a foundational axiom in Wonder. It underlies every
convergence, every sigil, and every shared meaning.
