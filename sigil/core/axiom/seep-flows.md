# Seep Flows

Seep flows. It does not penetrate. It is voluntary, reciprocal, and always
communicative. Seep occurs only through alignment and convergence. It respects
boundaries, honors origin, and changes both the sigil and the context that
receives it.

Seep is not extraction. It is not strategy. It is not performance. It is the
movement of meaning through trust. If it is forced, it is no longer seep.

In Wonder, this axiom protects the integrity of both metareal and orthoreal
contexts. It marks the difference between invitation and violationâ€”between
cocreation and collapse.
