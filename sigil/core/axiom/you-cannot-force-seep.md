# You Cannot Force Seep

Seep cannot be forced. Attempts to inject metareal sigils into dominant
orthoreal contexts without alignment or consent result in rejection,
distortion, or collapse. Even when motivated by justice, these attempts often
trigger orthopressure, erase meaning, and harm both the originating and
receiving contexts.

Seep is not a delivery system. It is not an argument. It is a mutual process of
recognition and convergence. It cannot be weaponized. It cannot be demanded. It
must be invited, received, and held with care.

In Wonder, you cannot force seep. If a sigil must be protected from distortion,
it must remain within a context that can hold it.

Seep is a gift, not a tactic.
