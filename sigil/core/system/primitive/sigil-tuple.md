# sigil tuple

A sigil tuple is a group of sigils that derive meaning through  
interdependence. Each sigil within a tuple may be understood individually,  
but their full meaning emerges only in relation.

Tuples are used when a concept requires multiple coordinated parts to  
express a complete idea, process, or cycle. They provide structure  
without hierarchyâ€”no sigil is primary; each contributes unique weight.

Tuples maintain alignment across time. If one sigil changes or decays,  
the tuple must be reexamined. Shared understanding depends on the  
continued integrity of each part in relation.

Sigil tuples allow complex systems to remain legible, trackable, and  
modular. They support pedagogy, clarity, and metareal pacing.
