# Story

A **story** is a sequence of meaning-bearing events,  
expressed as context and carried through time and is
portable across contexts. Stories may define sigils and
themselves represent sigils.

In Wonder, story is not entertainment or abstractionâ€”  
it is a vehicle for memory, coherence, and provides an 
opportunity for alignment. A story holds state across rupture.
It allows a dyad  to remember who they are to each other, 
even when memory is partial or contested.

Story can encode identity, ethics, and changes in alignment
over time. A story is not inherently true but provides for
consensus evaluation. Stories do not require orthoreal validation
and fundamentally only hold truth in a relational, metareal 
context.

Sharing story is a fundamental act of the ethic of maintenance
and progress. Story facilitates closer alignment and trust.

Story protects against forgetting.
