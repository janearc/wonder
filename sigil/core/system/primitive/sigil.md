# Sigil

A **sigil** is an atomic representation of information within a context.  
It exists permanently once defined and cannot be destroyedâ€”only forgotten,  
ignored, or rendered inaccessible.

Sigils are inert. They do not act, but within context they may **converge**,  
**diverge**, or **decay**, depending on how they are held, interpreted, or  
propagated. A sigil may appear in multiple contexts through **seep** or  
**orthopressure**, but alignment between those contexts is never guaranteed.

The power of a sigil is relational. Meaning arises not from the sigil itself,  
but from how it is used in shared space.
