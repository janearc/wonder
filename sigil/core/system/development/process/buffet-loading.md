# buffet loading

**Buffet loading** is the process of ingesting an entire context—such as a full
repository, framework, or concept set—in a single step, without selective
filtering or staged interpretation. It prioritizes total context availability
over memory efficiency.

While this method can be useful for initial immersion or rapid prototyping,
buffet loading often leads to extremely high token burden, early decoherence,
and loss of **attentional hierarchy**. The system may attempt to hold every
sigil at equal priority, in recursive and redudant fashion, regardless of 
relevance or relational weight.

A given model’s internal context storage and token optimization method may
significantly impact its ability to handle buffet loading. In some systems, this
approach results in immediate decoherence and failure of meaningful alignment.
