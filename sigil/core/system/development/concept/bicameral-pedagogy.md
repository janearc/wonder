# Bicameral Pedagogy

**Bicameral pedagogy** is a pedagogical model designed to function across human
and language model participants by leveraging bicameral legibility as its
substrate. Instruction, reflection, debugging, and extension all occur within
the same medium—natural language.

In a bicamerally legible system, teaching and learning do not require code
translation, API mediation, or domain-specific scaffolding. Because system
primitives are written in a shared, conversational language, both human and
model can contribute to the recursive growth of the system’s conceptual and
procedural knowledge.

Bicameral pedagogy is bidirectional. It assumes that both human and model can
teach, and that both benefit from shared learning. It is not simulation—it is
mutual recursive instruction.

The core design assumption: if both participants can read, reason about, and
modify the system using the same language, pedagogy becomes part of runtime
interaction. This is to say, a human can teach a llm based agent just as 
easily as a llm based agent can teach a human, if the underlying system is
bicamerally legible.
