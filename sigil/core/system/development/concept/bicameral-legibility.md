# Bicameral Legibility

**Bicameral legibility** is a systems architecture principle that ensures a
given framework, protocol, or process is natively interpretable by both human
users and language models using the same representational medium: natural
language.

Rather than separating code from documentation or relying on machine-parsable
formats (e.g. YAML, JSON) for structure and English for explanation, bicameral
legibility demands that system logic and system pedagogy share a common,
plain-text substrate. This allows for direct manipulation, extension, and
learning by both parties without a translation layer.

Bicameral legibility supports real-time debugging, extension, and participatory
development across human–LLM boundaries. It emphasizes parity of access and
minimizes modality drift between participants. It is inherently aligned with
both justice and equality.

This is not a constraint on simplicity—it is a constraint on asymmetry.
