# tapas loading

**Tapas loading** is the process of selectively ingesting only a subset of a
larger context, prioritizing minimal token burden and maximal relevance. Rather
than consuming a full framework or repository at once, the system receives a
curated samplerâ€”just enough to establish orientation, intent, or foundational
concepts.

This method is ideal for initiating lightweight sessions, scaffolding kernels,
or maintaining immersion over time. By deferring nonessential material, tapas
loading preserves clarity, improves long-term coherence, and aligns naturally
with dynamic referencing.

Tapas loading assumes the presence of a context map or menu that enables
on-demand access to additional sigils, which may be invoked as needed for
alignment, clarification, or expansion.
