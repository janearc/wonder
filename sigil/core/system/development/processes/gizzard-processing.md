# gizzard processing

Gizzard processing is the act of performing a two-pass ingestion of a
bicamerally legible framework. The first pass uses a language model to distill
complex, human-readable sigils into a reduced token burden format—machine-
optimized directives or summaries. These processed directives are then fed in a
second stage to either the same or a different language model for runtime use.

Gizzard processing is inherently lossy. It strips bicameral legibility and
reduces nuance in favor of coherence and efficiency. The resulting output may
preserve structure and alignment, but it sacrifices the richness and
pedagogical clarity of the original framework.

While suboptimal, gizzard processing may be necessary when working with
language models that lack efficient internal context storage or symbol mapping.
It is a compensatory mechanism—used to adapt robust, expressive architectures
to systems that cannot otherwise handle their complexity.

Gizzard processing should be avoided when possible. Prefer simplified sigils
and lighter loading methods such as tapas loading over buffet loading,
especially when working within strict token constraints.
