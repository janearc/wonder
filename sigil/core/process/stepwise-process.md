# stepwise process

Stepwise process is a method of problem solving grounded in the ethic  
of compassionate effort and the ethic of effectiveness. It supports  
action when capacity is low and autonomy is limited.

The process begins with accepting the current state without judgment.  
From that place, one task is chosenâ€”small, relevant, survivable.

The task is completed with care. Then rest. The act is recognized as  
meaningful, regardless of size.

The process may repeat or end after one step. Either is valid.

Stepwise process prioritizes coherence, not productivity. It honors  
movement without self-erasure.
