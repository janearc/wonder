# Convergence

Convergence is the process by which two or more local contexts create shared
meaning. It is not agreement. It is not persuasion. It is the recursive,
deliberate act of bringing individual understandings into alignment—through
language, vulnerability, and care.

Convergence requires disclosure and honesty. Each participant must offer
their internal, local meanings for shared inspection, knowing those meanings may
change. It is a bidirectional exchange of power—not an act of submission, not a
contest to be won. It does not seek to overpower or convince. It seeks to
understand and align.

Convergence may involve compromise, but never coercion. It is a process, not a
result—and authenticity is its foundation. Without vulnerability, convergence
cannot occur. Without an ethic of maintenance, it cannot hold.

In Wonder, convergence governs all sigil formation. A sigil is not stable until
it has converged alignment. Once stable, it can be referenced, invoked, and
shared without redefinition—until drift or rupture demands reconvergence.

Drift and decay are not failures. They are expected. Convergence is how we meet
them—again and again, in motion, together.

To converge is to build meaning in real time, with real people, for real
reasons.
