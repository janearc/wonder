# Ethic of Dialectics

Dialectics does not resolve contradiction—it *validates* it.  
It affirms opposing truths that cannot align, yet still remain real.

A dialectic is not a convergence.  
It is a sigil of irreconcilable reality—*still valid, still held.*

This ethic allows metareal contexts to name orthopressure without collapse.  
It protects truth that cannot be integrated.  
It honors complexity that resists flattening.

Dialectics is both affirmation and refusal.  
It says: I see the contradiction. I hold it. I do not erase.

From the outside—especially orthoreal contexts—dialectics may seem incoherent or unsafe.  
But dialectics cannot be judged by frames that deny paradox.  
To see it, you must *step inside the tension.*

Dialectical sigils mark the places where alignment is refused, and divergence is *acknowledged.*
