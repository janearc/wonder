# Ethic of Repair

The ethic of repair is the shared commitment to address rupture within a
metareal context through honesty, care, and mutual effort. It does not assume
blame—it assumes responsibility. Repair is not about punishment or resolution.
It is about returning to alignment after a breach in shared understanding.

Repair begins with acknowledgment. It requires the willingness to name what
broke, why it matters, and what it would take to rebuild. It must be entered
with consent, clarity of intention, and space for each participant to speak and
be heard.

In Wonder, repair is not a backup plan—it is part of the design. Rupture is
expected. What matters is how it is held. The ethic of repair protects against
drift, prevents burnout, and deepens convergence over time.

Without a shared ethic of repair, rupture becomes erasure.

To repair is to say: I still want to walk with you.
