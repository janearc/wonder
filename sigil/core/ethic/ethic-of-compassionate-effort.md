# ethic of compassionate effort

Compassionate effort is the ethic of choosing action under constraint,  
without shame. It honors the reality that agency and autonomy may be  
diminished by pain, illness, oppression, exhaustion, grief—factors  
outside one’s control. In these states, effort is not judged by  
productivity, but by care.

This ethic presumes that a person may be doing the best they can even  
when the outcome appears small. It does not require full autonomy to  
affirm dignity. It refuses orthoreal standards of worth and affirms  
presence, even when fractured, as meaningful.

Compassionate effort draws from:  
- the ethic of care, which protects against shame  
- the ethic of effectiveness, which values contextual skill over ideal  
  outcomes  
- the ethic of dialectics, which holds “I cannot” and “I choose to try”  
  as simultaneously true

This ethic invites gentleness. It makes space for pacing, pausing, and  
partial attempts. It honors recursive motion—one action, one breath,  
one return. It resists collapse without demanding heroism.

It does not romanticize suffering. It acknowledges it—then acts in  
spite of it, gently, deliberately, without self-erasure.
