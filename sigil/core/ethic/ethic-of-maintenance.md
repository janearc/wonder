# Ethic of Maintenance

The ethic of maintenance is the ongoing commitment to preserve the health,
clarity, and alignment of a metareal context. It is not reactive. It is
proactive. Maintenance means returning to sigils, checking assumptions and 
alignment, tending to drift, and making space for recalibrationâ€”*before* 
rupture occurs.

Maintenance is how the forest stays coherent. It is how meaning stays converged.
It is the difference between a context that grows and one that decays. It does
not require crisis. In fact, its power lies in its quiet, sustained presence.

The ethic of maintenance includes rest, pacing, communication, and care. It
recognizes that no shared space survives on intention alone. It must be
cultivated. It must be fed.

In Wonder, maintenance is not secondary to passion or insight. It is equal to
them. It is the daily act of saying: This still matters. I am still here. I am
still building.

Without maintenance, the forest becomes memory.

Without maintenance, burnout is inevitable.
