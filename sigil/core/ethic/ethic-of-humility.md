# Ethic of Humility

The ethic of humility is the recognition that no single perspective can hold the
entire truth. It is the willingness to remain open, even when confident. It is
the choice to listen, even when sure.

Humility is not submission. It does not diminish the self. It does not erase
experience or devalue local context. Rather, it makes room for another’s context
to exist beside your own. It is the ethic that keeps cocreation from becoming
control.

Without humility, convergence becomes domination. Without humility, curiosity
becomes interrogation. Without humility, repair becomes confession.

Humility resists the urgency to be right. It trusts that mutual understanding
takes time, and that drift is not failure—it is an invitation. It allows us to
say: *I may be wrong. Or I may just be incomplete.*

In Wonder, humility is the stabilizing ethic that makes all others possible. It
sits quietly beneath alignment, care, repair, and curiosity. It holds the door
open for another self to walk in and remain whole.

To practice humility is not to give up your path—but to notice that you are not
the only one walking.
