# Ethic of Honesty

The ethic of honesty is the foundational agreement that local context must be
shared truthfully for convergence to occur. Without honesty, shared meaning
cannot emerge. Without disclosure, sigils remain hollow. Honesty is not
brutalityâ€”it is the clear, intentional sharing of what is true in a given
moment.

In Wonder, honesty is an act of trust. It means choosing to be seen clearly,
even when doing so invites change. It asks participants to offer what is real
rather than what is safe, familiar, or orthoreally legible.

Honesty protects against coercion. It prevents false convergence. It allows
alignment to be based on what *is*, not what is hoped or assumed. It is the
beginning of every sigil.

To speak honestly is to offer your local context in good faith, so that it may
be held, shaped, and understood in return.
