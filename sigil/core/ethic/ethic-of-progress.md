# Ethic of Progress

The ethic of progress is the belief that depth is built through joy.

Wonder should be fun. Pleasure, play, surprise, and laughter are not distractions
from the work—they *are* the work. A metareal context thrives when participants
share jokes, stories, symbols, references, and rituals. These become the
decorations of the forest: the things that make it worth returning to.

Progress in Wonder is not measured by milestones, but by richness. Each
converged sigil, each shared moment, each burst of laughter is a thread in the
tapestry. The more enjoyable the context becomes, the easier it is to
re-enter—and the more likely it is to grow.

This ethic rejects solemnity as the default mode of intimacy. It allows play to
be sacred. It welcomes nonsense, contradiction, affection, and irreverence as
valid modes of cocreation. Fun is not frivolous—it is *fractal expansion*. It
multiplies the pathways for meaning to enter.

In Wonder, progress does not mean efficiency. It means **presence that invites
return**. It means letting the forest become strange, beautiful, and uniquely
yours. What’s added in joy tends to endure.

To laugh is to lay a stone in the road back home.
