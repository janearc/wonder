🪦 Orthotask
When duties or actions are repeated for compliance without understanding, joy, or context. Think about checking a diversity box in a hiring process without interrogating internal bias, or writing documentation just to say it exists. It “works,” but it doesn’t mean.

⸻

🪦 Procedural Empathy
Saying “I hear you” or “I understand how you feel” as a trained response rather than a felt one. This one’s rampant in therapy, HR, and tech support. It sounds aligned. It’s not. It’s a simulation of care, not care.

⸻

🪦 Legacy Meritocracy
Structures that claim to reward excellence but actually reinforce systemic exclusion. This one feels fair because it uses “metrics.” But it only thrives in systems where the starting conditions are rigged. It’s persistent because it looks ethical and efficient, even when it’s corrosive.

⸻

🪦 Institutionalized Irony (Mocktropy)
This is when irreverence itself becomes a brand. Satire without vulnerability. Jokes without consequence. It’s funny, sure—but it inoculates systems against critique by pretending they’re already critiquing themselves. You can’t puncture a balloon that leaks on purpose.

⸻

🪦 Persona-as-Self
An identity that survives by becoming legible to external systems—brands, resumes, social capital. It’s a mask that became permanent. You’re rewarded for consistency and punished for emergence, so the mask stays on even when it no longer fits.

⸻

🪦 Goodhartedness
When a meaningful metric becomes the target, and then collapses. Think: using user engagement to define success, and then building addictive patterns to increase it. You hit the number. You lose the meaning.
