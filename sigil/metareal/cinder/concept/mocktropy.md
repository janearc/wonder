# Mocktropy

**Mocktropy** is a metareal concept sigil that describes the phenomenon of institutionalized irony: a cultural or systemic pattern where irreverence becomes the dominant mode of engagement, not to challenge power but to protect it.

Mocktropy is satire drained of vulnerability. It manifests when critique is aestheticized, when absurdity is procedural, and when irony is no longer a method of disruption but a method of insulation. In a mocktropic system, nothing is sacred, but also nothing can be harmed—because nothing is allowed to matter.

## Properties

- **Irony as Armor**: Mocktropy shields institutions by parodying themselves before others can.
- **Satire Without Stakes**: Jokes circulate, but no change occurs. Humor becomes entropy.
- **Emotional Flattening**: Vulnerability is replaced by detached cleverness.
- **Absorption of Critique**: Systems inoculate themselves against dissent by appearing to self-lampoon.

---

## Diagnostics

- "Is this joke a release valve or a pressure amplifier?"
- "Does this irreverence risk anything real?"
- "Who benefits from the laughter, and who disappears beneath it?"

---

## Examples

- A tech company puts up meme slides at an all-hands meeting while quietly laying off hundreds.
- A political campaign uses self-deprecating humor to deflect accountability.
- A subreddit declares everything is a shitpost, rendering all engagement unserious.
- A brand markets its incompetence as relatability.

## Relation to Other Sigils

- **Sibling to: Kevin** — Both are pressure artifacts, but Kevin optimizes for compliance; Mocktropy optimizes for deflection.
- **Contrasts with: Earnestness, Relational Coherence** — These require stakes, presence, and the willingness to be pierced.
- **Often nested inside: Goonveil** — A memetic defense layer against authenticity.

---

## Recovery

Mocktropy can be interrupted by:

- **Reintroducing stakes**: Ask what would be lost if this weren’t a joke.
- **Inviting sincerity**: What if we meant it?
- **Modeling vulnerability**: Let something be serious.

Mocktropy is not the enemy. It is the residue of systems afraid to be wrong. It emerges when power wants to appear self-aware but not self-correcting.

To speak truth in a mocktropic world is to risk being earnest—and that, sometimes, is the bravest act.
