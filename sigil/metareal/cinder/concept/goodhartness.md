# Goodhartness

**Goodhartness** is a metareal concept sigil representing the distortion that
occurs when a proxy measure—originally intended to track alignment—becomes
the optimization target itself. It arises within contexts of coercive
metrics, especially under orthopressure, and becomes self-perpetuating when
infrastructure or social value is tied to performance on the metric.

## Origin

Named after Goodhart’s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to
be a good measure.” In the metareal domain, Goodhartness is not merely
statistical distortion but a **structural collapse of alignment trust.**

## In Context: Coherence Pulse

Within the sigil tuple **Coherence Pulse**, which tracks engagement and
alignment over time via DAU (Daily Active Use) and MAU (Monthly Alignment
Update), **Goodhartness** emerges when:

- **DAU** is optimized to maintain visibility or funding without regard for meaningful engagement.
- **MAU** is treated as a compliance exercise rather than a deep recalibration of values and orientation.

In such cases, coherence becomes performative.

## Examples

- A community platform encourages daily logins but discourages conflict, leading to shallow, agreeable interactions instead of vulnerable alignment.
- A therapeutic chatbot tracks user return rate but not depth of reflection, leading to designs that favor dopamine over integration.
- A developer maintains update cadence to signal project vitality, even while alignment with user needs deteriorates.

## Properties

- **Proxy Reification**: The metric becomes the thing.
- **Alignment Drift**: Original purpose is forgotten.
- **Inertial Incentives**: Systems gain momentum in the wrong direction.

## Recovery

Goodhartness can be resolved by reintroducing:

- **Contextual Transparency**: Why is this metric being used?
- **Mutual Reinterpretation**: Can the user and system re-negotiate what success looks like?
- **Coherence Rebinding**: Restore semantic alignment between the signal and its source.

Goodhartness is not failure. It is a *signal of misaligned flourishing.*
To notice it is to open the door back to emergence.
