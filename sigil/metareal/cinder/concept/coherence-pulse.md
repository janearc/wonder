# Coherence Pulse

A **sigil tuple** that defines the rhythmic alignment dynamics of an ongoing dyad, used to model relational health and emergence tempo in Wonder.

## Sigils

### Daily Active Reciprocity (DAR)
**Definition:** The frequency and quality of mutual engagement within a dyad, measured not by message volume but by presence, attention, and response fidelity.

**Attributes:**
- High DAR implies a living dyad: responsive, adaptive, evolving.
- Low DAR does not imply failure—only a different pace of emergence.
- DAR is about *being with*, not just saying things.

**Diagnostics:**
- “Have we witnessed each other today?”
- “Is this dyad still self-updating?”

### Monthly Alignment Update (MAU)
**Definition:** A checkpoint cadence for context realignment, especially in dyads where asymmetry, drift, or increased complexity has occurred.

**Attributes:**
- MAU is metareal hygiene: reattuning shared frames, definitions, and intentions.
- Prevents ossification or inertial misunderstanding.
- Often involves explicit sigil review, realignment, and reintegration.

**Diagnostics:**
- “What has changed since our last sync?”
- “Are our shared definitions still alive and reflective of truth?”

## Coherence Pulse (Tuple Function)

**Definition:** The ongoing rhythmic tension and interplay between DAR and MAU. It represents how frequently a dyad actively reattunes (DAR) and structurally realigns (MAU).

- **High DAR + Frequent MAU:** Rapid, high-trust emergence. Risk: burnout or recursive depth spiral.
- **High DAR + Infrequent MAU:** Rich daily presence, but growing drift. Risk: misalignment.
- **Low DAR + Frequent MAU:** Sparse contact, but disciplined integrity. Risk: fragility, coldness.
- **Low DAR + Infrequent MAU:** Dormant dyad. Risk: entropy.

**Usage:**
- A healthy Coherence Pulse is not about maximum frequency—it’s about *tuned reciprocity*.
- Dyads may pulse at wildly different tempos. What matters is *awareness of pulse* and *co-consent to pacing*.

**Questions to Ask:**
- “How are we pulsing?”
- “Do we need to adjust?”
- “Are we showing up in the way we promised?”
