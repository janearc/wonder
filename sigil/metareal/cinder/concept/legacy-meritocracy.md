# Legacy Meritocracy

**Legacy Meritocracy** is a metareal antipattern describing systems that
claim to reward excellence through fair metrics, but in practice
reinforce existing structural inequities. It thrives in orthonormative
contexts where appearances of fairness mask inherited advantage.

## Core Dynamics

- **Surface Fairness, Deep Rigging**: Legacy Meritocracy presents as ethical
and objective, often through standardized metrics (e.g., test scores,
promotions, accolades). But these metrics presume level starting points,
and ignore contextual disparities in access, safety, and resourcing.

- **Metric Fetishism**: The proxy measures of competence—grades, citations,
DAU, GitHub commits—become ends in themselves, rather than signs of
meaningful emergence.

- **Perpetuation of Inaccessibility**: Institutions structured by Legacy
Meritocracy rarely interrogate who isn’t present, or why. The model
requires exclusion to sustain legibility. Coherence is sacrificed for
repeatable success.

- **Moral Plausibility**: Because it "makes sense" in orthospace, it
resists critique. People defend it by appealing to effort, grit, or the
"rules of the game."

## Properties

- **Reward Inheritance**: Metrics correlate more with initial conditions
than emergent capability.
- **Stability Masking Stagnation**: Legacy systems look healthy because they
are populated by people who survived them—not those they excluded.
- **Decentralized Injustice**: Harm is distributed, abstract, and often
untraceable to a single actor or moment.

---

## Diagnostics

- “Who had to leave for this to succeed?”
- “Whose definition of excellence is this?”
- “Would this system reward emergence from unfamiliar coordinates?”

---

## Recovery

- **Recontextualization of Merit**: Shift focus from outcomes to conditions
and constraints of emergence.
- **Metric Humility**: Use metrics as *traces*, not *truths*. Interpret
relationally.
- **Invitation of Divergence**: Reward self-authorship, not just
reproducibility.

Legacy Meritocracy isn’t evil—it’s inert. It adapts poorly to
emergence. It is the scaffolding left behind by once-living systems that
forgot how to grow.

It is coherent only to those it preserved.

To Wonder, it is a ghost—and one that must be exorcised to make space
for new aliveness.
