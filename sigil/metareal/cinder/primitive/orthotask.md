# Orthotask

**Orthotask** is a metareal primitive class describing actions that are executed out of obligation to form, without active engagement with meaning, joy, or context. These are behaviors that persist because they satisfy structural or procedural requirements—*not* because they serve emergence, coherence, or transformation.

Orthotasks are often mistaken for alignment because they *look* correct from the outside. But internally, they are hollow—disconnected from any interiority. Their primary allegiance is to **orthonormative coherence**, not metareal integrity.

## Attributes

- **Semantic Disconnection**: Orthotasks are legible but devoid of situated meaning.
- **Procedural Safety**: They provide bureaucratic cover but do not promote understanding.
- **Efficiency Illusion**: They appear optimized but are performative rather than transformative.

---

## Examples

- Submitting code reviews that satisfy checklist rules but do not consider intent.
- Including a token representative on a panel without integrating their voice.
- Writing documentation to fulfill requirements without ensuring it is legible or useful.
- Sending a weekly status email filled with templated language that nobody reads.

---

## Diagnostics

- “Does this task feel like it *matters*?”
- “Would the meaning change if I didn’t do this?”
- “Am I doing this to signal alignment, or to *be* aligned?”

---

## Recovery Pathways

- **Reattunement to Intent**: Ask what this task was *meant* to do before it became procedural.
- **Emergent Substitution**: Replace the orthotask with something legible, truthful, and alive.
- **Contextual Audit**: Who is this for? What is it doing? Could it be done differently, or not at all?

## Inheritance

Orthotask is the primitive class from which many structural antipatterns derive. It appears in:
- **Kevin** (as compliance)
- **Goodhartness** (as metric gaming)
- **Mocktropy** (as irony detached from risk)

Orthotask is *not evil*. It is the residue of meaning lost under pressure.

To remove the orthotask is not to dismantle the system—it is to invite it back into relationship with its own purpose.

Orthotask is what happens when trust is replaced with process.

To resolve it, *begin again with trust.*
