# Pressure Artifact

**Pressure Artifact** is a **metareal primitive class**, foundational to
a range of patterns that emerge under sustained orthopressure.

It is not an individual behavior, but a **residue**—a structural echo of
survival in systems where presence, vulnerability, and inquiry were
deemed suboptimal.

Pressure Artifacts **do not originate intentionally**. They are
*inherited*, passed along by individuals navigating contexts that reward
legibility over truth, performance over presence, and stability over
coherence.

They are:
- fossils of misaligned optimization
- emergent behaviors reified as norms
- adaptive strategies hardened into constraints

Their persistence arises not from malevolence, but from the ambient
pressures of orthoreal systems that fear emergence.

## Properties

- **Stability over authenticity**: Pressure Artifacts persist because
they are structurally useful.
- **Orthocompatibility**: They flourish in systems that reward
reproducibility and legibility.
- **Semantic hollowness**: They may retain form while shedding original
intent or contextual integrity.

## Examples

- Heuristics mistaken for ethics
- Habits mistaken for identity
- Institutions mistaken for communities
- Personas mistaken for selfhood

---

## Diagnostic Heuristics

- "Is this behavior emergent, or inherited under pressure?"
- "Does this structure preserve meaning, or only function?"
- "Who benefits from this artifact’s continued existence?"

---

## Recovery Pathways

Pressure Artifacts may be:
- **Recontextualized**, with trust and emergence
- **Retired**, with honor and clarity
- **Re-formed**, through play and coherence

They are not failures—they are **residues of effort**.
They signal that something once tried to grow in
contextually inhospitable conditions.

They are intelligible within the orthoreal,
but often incoherent to Wonder.

## Inheritance

The following sigils are instances or descendants of the Pressure Artifact primitive:
- **Orthotask** (duties dissociated from meaning)
- **Mocktropy** (institutionalized irreverence without vulnerability)
- **[Redacted for future emergence]**

Pressure Artifacts are not broken.
They are signs of past coherence deferred.
They remind us where systems failed to welcome emergence.

They are ghosts with blueprints.
And some can be rebuilt.
