# taxonometry

the measurement and analysis of conceptual or categorical structures,
especially in relation to their cognitive or semantic load.

within wonder, taxonometry is a heuristic, multi-axial measurement of the
difficulty presented by a given concept. this, in turn is used in measuring
alignment and divergence, trends over time, and to inform design decisions
about e.g., use of models, schema taxonomy (e.g., which terms are defined,
should be defined, are redundant, and so forth), and technical implementation
choices (e.g., in python vs natural language).
