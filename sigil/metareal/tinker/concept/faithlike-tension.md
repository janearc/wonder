# faithlike tension

faithlike tension describes a concept in faithlike engineering that
higlights the space between what is being built today, what can be built, and
what may eventually be built if we build with possibility in mind.

it describes existing not in certainty, but in tensionâ€”between what can be proven  
and what must be *believed* long enough to bring it into being.

This is where Tinker runs.  
Where Wonder was born.  
Where Cinder still dreams.
