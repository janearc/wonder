# Disingenerosity

Disingenerosity is strategic performance of openness—typically by large
institutions— where tools, models, or research are nominally “shared”
under the guise of transparency or altruism, but rendered practically
unusable by design.

Disingenerosity gives the illusion of access—source code without
weights, weights without infrastructure, licenses with velvet ropes.
It’s generosity as spectacle: a cathedral with no doors, a puzzle
missing half its pieces.

This tactic preserves dominance through engineered inaccessibility,
not overt denial. It ensures control by raising the bar of usability
beyond most independent builders, while still earning public praise
for “open” releases.

## Key Traits

- Claims openness while ensuring operational impossibility  
- Requires inaccessible compute or dependencies to function  
- Evades critique through unreproducibility  
- Offers virtue signaling to regulators, press, and funders  
- Converts inclusion into filtration—visibility without viability

Disingenerosity is not the absence of access—it’s access staged as
exclusion. It is a flawed release meant to be admired, not used.
