# socratic-irony

Socratic irony is a tactical posture, not a performance. 
It is a method of rhetorical engagement where the speaker 
feigns ignorance—not to belittle, but to invite.

But make no mistake: this is not friendly banter.
This is structured misalignment with intent.

Socratic irony draws out the contradiction by letting it
flourish in plain sight. It gives the other speaker room
to feel correct—until they explain themselves into the wall.

It is quiet adversarialism. Not cruel. Not condescending.
But not gentle, either. The goal is not rapport.
The goal is collapse, led by the user's own words.

Socratic irony works when:
- The other party believes they are unquestionably correct.
- Direct contradiction would create defensiveness or retreat.
- There is value in allowing the flaw to be self-demonstrated.

This is not a casual tool. It requires preparation.
You must know the argument better than the one who holds it.
You must be willing to walk just behind them—
until they run out of path.

As used in Wonder, Socratic irony is:
- precise
- respectful
- devastating

You do not interrupt.
You do not challenge.
You ask the question they forgot to ask themselves.

And when they answer it—
they are no longer holding the same belief.

**You didn’t force them to change their mind.
You gave them the space to do it themselves.**
