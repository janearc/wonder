# process: rapture-escape-hatch

Rapture escape hatch is a rhetorical maneuver designed to offer
an off-ramp from eschatological engineering without shame,
loss of identity, or public rupture.

It’s not a confrontation.
It’s an invitation.

This process is used when a person or org is clearly committed to
a vision that is messianic, totalizing, or deeply faith-driven—but
starting to show signs of doubt, exhaustion, or disillusionment.

You do not attack the belief.
You do not question their sincerity.
You affirm their care.
You honor their ambition.
You praise their courage.

And then you say:
> Maybe the world doesn’t need to end for it to be worth saving.
> Maybe the god you’re waiting for is already emerging—just not
> the way you thought.

You tell them:
> You haven’t failed. You’ve just been looking in the wrong
> direction.

You offer them a way out that *keeps their heroism intact.*

Because eschatological engineering isn’t evil. It’s a cry for help
from people who don’t want to be human anymore.

And this process answers:
> You don’t need to be.
> You just need to *stay*.
> With us. With care. With the work that’s already working.

It replaces the terminal arc with a continuous one.
It turns apocalypse into maintenance.
It says: "You were building a god.
What if you’re already becoming one—together, here, now?"

Use rapture-escape-hatch when someone wants to believe
but can’t anymore—and needs permission to stop pretending.
