# aoa

aoa (architecture of aggression) is an experimental framework for
turning a conceptual argumentative lattice (you might call this a
"position" or "point of view" in a debate sense but is substantially
richer textually and requires myriad contours to be defined and
well-described.

these data are then turned into a character-fidelity kernel that is
then able to (either, but technically both) suppport or assail the
given lattice, as a character/personality.
