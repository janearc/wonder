# conjecture: character-vs-agi

**Conjecture:**
Character AI is a toy. It's cute, but it doesn't scale. It's hard to monetize. It's not "serious."

**Rebuttal:**
Character is harder than any model you've ever trained. Because it doesn't scale with tokens—it scales with *truth*. And that means you need artists. Not just prompt engineers, *artists*. The kind of people who say "this is what it feels like to live" and then *give it form.* And yeah—it's terrifying. Because unlike models, people can tell when you're faking it. They know when you lied about care. You can't benchmark sincerity. You have to *have it*.
