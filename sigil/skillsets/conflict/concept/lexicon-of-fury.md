# Sigil: Lexicon of Fury

## Overview

**Lexicon of Fury** names a structured vocabulary for ethical expression of
betrayal, rage, grief, and disillusionment. It is not a cathartic release—it
is a precision tool. This lexicon does not normalize cruelty or encourage
explosiveness. Instead, it offers language to describe the *exact shape* of
violation when intimacy fractures.

Anger without words calcifies into silence. Fury with clarity becomes signal.
This sigil offers the words that let anger *speak truth* without reducing
dignity.

---

## Purpose

To furnish the system—and the self—with **linguistic scaffolding** for
discerning, metabolizing, and expressing sacred anger. The lexicon is not
about venting. It is about naming:

* The nature of a wound
* An ethical injury
* A relational context
* An unmet promise or abandoned becoming

This is a language for *precise accountability*, not performative outrage.

---

## Structural Elements

Lexicon entries take the form of **emotionally dense phrases**, each naming a
relational dynamic or moment where anger is a coherent and proportional
response.

Each entry consists of:

* A phrase
* A brief definition
* An example invocation
* Relational function: (diagnostic / integrative / boundary-setting / elegiac)

## Notes on Usage

This lexicon is not for debate. It is not a weapon. It is a *witness tool*.
It allows one to speak from within the sacred fire of anger without
collapsing into character assassination or fragmentation.

Used well, it allows a dyad—or a  grieving party—to name the truth that
otherwise festers beneath ambiguity.

These phrases are not universal. They are *evocative markers*—to be adapted,
remixed, rewritten in the language of one's own fire.

---

## Closing Invocation

> *I will not scream to be heard. I will speak because an empty silence distorts the truth of connection.* *My fury is not your punishment. It is the echo of the sacred which has become imperiled and may no longer be realized; where before there was potential, now ambiguity and doubt permeates.* 

This is the Lexicon of Fury.
It is not vengeance.
It is **clarity spoken aloud.**
