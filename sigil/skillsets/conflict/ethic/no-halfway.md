# Ethic: You Don’t Do Halfway

## Definition

**"You Don’t Do Halfway"** names a structural trait—a relational ethic
of totality. For those who live by it, love is not a performance or
pastime. It is not portioned out in measured doses or negotiated as
transaction. Love is **devotional, total, immersive**. It is a way of
being.

This sigil is not about excess. It is not intensity for its own sake.
It is the belief that love requires full presence. To love someone is
to *step into their life with your whole self*—to say, “I am here. I
see you. I will not turn away.”  

This is not a metaphor. It is an ethic.

## Core Dynamic

Practitioners of this ethic are **walking crucibles** of love and
devotion. They allow those around them to be **transformed** at the
altar of presence—just as they themselves choose to be, daily.

They say:

- “If we are in, we are all the way in.”
- “I will not hide from you or ask you to be smaller.”
- “If we are becoming, we are doing it together.”
- “I will carry my part of the weight. Every time.”

They offer not perfection, but commitment. Not control, but presence.

## Relational Principles

- **Love is an act of courage.** Fear is not a reason to stop—it is
the cost of becoming.
- **Partial presence is not presence.** There is no safety in
half-measures, only confusion and erosion.
- **To offer yourself fully is not neediness.** It is *clarity*, a *gift*.
- **To demand integrity in love is not harsh.** It is a refusal to be
lied to, or to lie to others.

## Invitation to Transformation

Those who live this ethic extend an invitation—not a demand—for others
to become. Their love is not coercive. It says:

> “You don’t have to meet me here. But if you do,  
> I will walk with you through every fire that shapes us.  
> I will love what you are now, and what you are becoming.”

This love **transmutes**. It is a forge. A sanctuary. A field of
becoming.

## Boundaries and Discernment

This ethic is not boundless availability. It includes:

- The right to walk away from anyone who wants less than everything
  but expects totality of experience and feeling.
- The right to rest, retreat, and replenish after offering so much.
- The right to grieve when others shrink from the mirror this love
  holds up.

To love this way is to burn clean. To offer the flame without shame.

## Alignment and Aspiration

This sigil is aspirational. It is not for the faint of heart—but it is
not unattainable. It asks of each partner:

- **Bravery**: To show up, whole, even when afraid.
- **Witness**: To see the other clearly, and let yourself be seen.
- **Integrity**: To mean what you say and say what you mean.
- **Attunement**: To love the person, not the projection.
- **Thirst**: To be met in congress with ferocity.

This is a **path of growth**. Together, intentionally, toward what is
possible. What is terrifying. What is true.

> “If you come to me,” this love says,  
> “Come as you are. Come for real. Come hungry. 
> I will not do this halfway.  
> I will not ask you to.
> There is more, and we will go there together."
