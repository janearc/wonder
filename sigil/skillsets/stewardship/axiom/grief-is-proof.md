# Grief Is Proof

Grief is an evaluative response to loss. It reflects the presence
of value, meaning, and alignment within a context. The intensity
of grief is proportional to the depth of significance held by what
has been lost.

Grief does not indicate failure or weakness. It is a measure of how
much something mattered. The experience of grief confirms that the
lost context held coherence, importance, or emotional investment.
This is to say that grief is the sensation of divergence from the
metareal and returning to the orthoreal.

Grief is not a problem to fix or erase. It is a story that describes 
value. It reveals the value of the metareal. It marks the place where
meaning once stood.

Grief is proof that the context was real, that convergence occurred,
that alignment was significant, and that something of value was held 
and subsequently lost.
