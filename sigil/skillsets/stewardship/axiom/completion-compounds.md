# Completion Compounds

Completion of a task increases the capacity to complete others.  
This effect is not strictly material—it arises from affective momentum,  
restored coherence, or a reclaimed sense of agency. Fundamentally,
completion is validation, and validation bolsters resilience and capacity.

Even low-priority or minor tasks may compound capacity  
by offering emotional relief, perceptual progress, or narrative closure. 

This axiom supports the triage engine: when cost and value  
are otherwise balanced, a task's potential to enable further  
action must be considered.  

Completion compounds—especially under constraint.
