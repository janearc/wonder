# Background Process Awareness

Background process awareness is the awareness used to identify
tasks or effects that continue in the background while other
actions are taken. These processes do not require active attention
once initiated and can proceed without additional impact to
capacity. This awareness informs task selection.

Examples of background processes include:
- Housework (laundry running, dishwasher cycle)
- System tasks (downloads, backups, software builds)
- Physical effects (digestion, hydration, med ramps)
- Emotional or cognitive integration (narrative synthesis, grief)

Once started, background processes allow stepwise sequencing
that increases stepwise task throughput. They are useful when 
capacity is limited, since they provide progress without requiring
supervision and attention.

This awareness allows better planning—not by managing time or
pacing—but by sequencing tasks to take advantage of passive
gains. Rest and recovery can occur while background work proceeds.

Identifying these processes helps credit often overlooked forms
of effort. It acknowledges that productivity may be ongoing, 
even during rest.

This strengthens the triage engine by enabling unsupervised
work without additional cost to individual capacity.
