# meds capacity cycle

Meds capacity cycle names a sigil tuple: `meds climb`, `meds altitude`,  
and `meds wall`. Together, these describe the arc of pharmacologically  
mediated capacity over time within a metareal context shaped by illness,  
disability, or affective instability.

These sigils are interdependent and must be understood in relation.  
Tracking this cycle supports self-awareness, dyadic pacing, and  
resource stewardship.

## meds climb

Meds climb marks the interval between medication ingestion and the arrival  
of functional capacity. During this time, therapeutic effect is building.  
It may feel subtle, delayed, or inconsistent—but emergence is not absence.  
Not-yet is still real.

Recognizing the climb prevents premature judgment. Planning during this  
phase means anticipating increasing ability and avoiding overcommitment  
before readiness stabilizes.

## meds altitude

Meds altitude names the functional plateau following a completed meds climb.  
In this window, therapeutic effect is present. Clarity, stability, and  
coordination may be temporarily restored. This state is limited, but powerful.

Meds altitude enables tasks requiring focus, movement, communication, or  
planning. It should be protected, not squandered. Dyadic scheduling may  
intentionally target altitude for conversation, effort, or shared action.

Stepwise processes often aim to reach altitude before engaging complex  
tasks. Altitude is not infinite—it is a precious and strategic window.

## meds wall

Meds wall marks the sudden drop in capacity following the end of a  
therapeutic window. This decline may feel abrupt and disorienting.  
Symptoms or disabilities that had been mitigated may return sharply.

Though the wall feels sudden, it is predictable. Unacknowledged, it becomes  
a rupture vector—especially in dyadic contexts. Tend the wall with care.  
Pausing, pacing, or reorienting together prevents harm.

## stewardship note

These sigils are most powerful when tracked, anticipated, and shared.  
In a dyadic container, naming the meds cycle makes capacity visible—  
allowing both parties to hold time and energy without shame, urgency,  
or invalidation.

This is not just strategy. It is care.
