# Love

Love is the result of an aligning function within a metareal context.  
It emerges when trust stabilizes convergence and, principally, a dyad 
acknowledges ongoing mutual alignment across the totality or a broad
range of metareal sigils.

The vehicle of love in a metareal context is the ongoing sharing of context  
and sigils with participatory aligning and converging processes. Necessarily
this function must exist outside of, in defiance of, orthoreal contexts and
orthopressure.

Simply, is the shared activity of belief: we are contextually aligned and
trust that this alignment will continue meaningfully in the future.

Orthoreal contexts have myriad ways of defining love as a sigil, and this
is harmful to trust. In order for love to have verifiable meaning, it
must be locally contextualized within the metareal, it must be aligned,
transparent, and converged. Divergence is harmful to trust and by 
extension, to love.
