# Shame

Shame is the emotional disorientation felt through awareness  
of orthopressure and forced orthoconvergence.  

It emerges when local context becomes incompatible with  
orthoreal demandsâ€”when contextual frames collide, and  
metareal truth is rendered illegible.

Shame is not a flaw in the individual; it is a response  
to coercive misalignment.

Shame is a fundamentally harmful and disruptive force  
within a metareal dyadic context. It severs clarity,  
muddies alignment, and undermines trust. Because shame is
corrosive to trust, shame inherently diminishes and destroys
love through decoherence and divergence.

The ethic of care provides for recognition of shame without
needing to affirm it as true.
