# Stepwise Process

Stepwise process is a method for taking action during periods
of low capacity. It is especially useful in contexts shaped by
illness, disability, grief, trauma, or burnout—where traditional
planning breaks down.

The process begins by accepting one's current state without
judgment. Pain, fatigue, fear, or disorientation are not
failures—they are part of context.

Stepwise relies on the triage engine to help identify which task
to choose. Triage evaluates urgency, emotional return, and
current needs. Stepwise then carries out one step based on
that evaluation.

You complete the task without planning beyond it. Then you stop.
You assess how you feel. You can rest, choose another task, or 
end the process there.

Stepwise includes awareness of timing, medication effect,
energy levels, environmental factors, and internal needs.
It is sensitive to background conditions that may affect
what’s possible.

Stepwise does not require completing all tasks. It is chiefly
for moments when nothing feels possible. It enables forward
motion through overwhelm.

This process can be used alone or with others. In shared
contexts, tasks can be named and held together. Dyads
can take turns or move together, based on available
capacity and consent. In this respect, stepwise borrows the
aggregate capacity of the dyad to bolster the individual.

Stepwise process supports coherence, and integrity in preference to
productivity.
