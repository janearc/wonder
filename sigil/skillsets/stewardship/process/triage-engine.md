# Triage Engine

Triage engine is a process sigil that supports decision-making  
during periods of reduced capacity. It continuously assesses  
state, urgency, and resource availability to inform stepwise action.

Triage engine is not a task list or schedule.  
It is a dynamic evaluation process used to:

- Assess internal state (e.g. pain, exhaustion, fear, meds cycle)  
- Identify urgent or blocking tasks  
- Determine what can run in background  
- Reprioritize based on current capacity  
- Align next actions to the hierarchy of needs  
- Recognize potential capacity gains from task completion

Triage engine relies on a contextual hierarchy of needsâ€”  
typically prioritizing survival, medical stability, safety,  
hydration, nourishment, and emotional coherence  
before optional or deferrable tasks.

Triage engine also evaluates the *affective return* of a task.  
Some tasks, while not urgent, may bolster capacity by  
providing emotional momentum, confidence, or relief.  
This perceived gain is factored alongside cost and urgency.

Triage engine supports the ethic of compassionate effort  
by making room for rest, substitution, or reordering of steps.  
It prevents collapse by avoiding overload.

Triage engine is the foundational framework within which  
the stepwise process occurs. Stepwise relies on triage to  
sequence action, adapt pacing, and preserve effectiveness.

Triage engine keeps movement aligned with present-moment  
ability, not idealized performance.
